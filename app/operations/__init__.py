    There's an important check here: before we divide, we need to make sure that 'b' is not zero.
    
    Why? Because dividing by zero doesn't work. If we try to divide by zero, we get a big error!
    
    So, if 'b' is zero, we raise a 'ZeroDivisionError', which is a way of telling the program, "Stop! You can't do this."
    Example: if we call division(10.0, 2.0), it will return 5.0.
    But if we call division(10.0, 0.0), it will raise a ZeroDivisionError and say "Cannot."
